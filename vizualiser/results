#### Configuration of Hadoop ####
#################################

In order to have the right number of Map Tasks, we have to change the 
parameter 'dfs.block.size' in the hdfs-site.xml file. 
So, in order to have 10 Map Tasks for a file 100 MB, we set the parameter to
(100 / 10) * 1024 *1024

For the cluster capacity of some map tasks, we change the parameter 
'mapred.tasktracker.map.tasks.maximum' in the mapred-site.xml file
So, for a cluster capacity of 2 map tasks, we set the parameter to 2.

For the slowstart, we change the parameter 'mapred.reduce.slowstart.completed.maps'
in the file mapred-site.xml.
So, in order to have a slowstart set to 50%, we set the parameter to 0.5.

#### Results ####

1. Execution time: 1 min 03 sec
2. Execution time: 1 min 30 sec

The second job is longer than the first one mostly because we use only a cluster capacity of
one map task in this case. So, it runs twenty tasks one by one, but for the first case, 
it runs ten tasks two by two, even if, in the first case, the map tasks are bigger (10 MB), 
than in the second case (5 MB), it should be faster.
