\section*{Question 1.1}
To evaluate the usefulness of speculation in a stressed environment, we run several jobs with the same configuration and the same data, the only change being the activation of the speculative execution.

In each job, we are going to stress one of the 5 nodes. In this purpose, we used a script to stress the disk (see in Annex [?]).

We used the benchmark \bench{sort} with a block size of 128MB, a replication factor of 3 and 8 map/reduce slots.

In the first two runs, we disable the speculation (speculative execution in \file{mapred-site.xml}).
In the next two runs, we enable the speculation.
