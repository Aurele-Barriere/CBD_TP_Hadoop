\maketitle

These experiments were done on 15 nodes.

\section*{Question 1.1}

We used a data set of 20GB, with replication factor

\section*{Question 1.2}

We used a data set of 20GB and run sort benchmark using block size at 128MB and the replication factor at 3.

We execute runs with different expiry interval (30seconds and 1 minutes), and stop the tasktracker daemon on one node (one time before the completion of the map tasks, another after this completion).

The next tables show the execution times and the number of killed tasks respectively.

\begin{center}
\captionof{table}{Execution times} 
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|}
\hline
\ & expiry interval: 30seconds & expiry interval: 1minutes \\
\hline
Before completion map & 8mins, 58sec & 14mins, 3sec \\
\hline
After completion map & 14mins, 41sec & 12mins, 27sec\\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

\begin{center}
\captionof{table}{Number of killed tasks} 
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|}
\hline
\ & expiry interval: 30seconds & expiry interval: 1minutes \\
\hline
Before completion map & 4 & 11 \\
\hline
After completion map & 21 & 13 \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}


\section*{Question 2.1}


We used a data set of 10GB and run wordcount and sort benchmarks using
different values (0.05, 0.5, and 1).

The next table shows the execution times.

\begin{center}
\captionof{table}{Execution times} 
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|}
\hline
\ & Sort & Wordcount \\
\hline
0.05 & 1mins, 2sec & 6mins, 55sec \\
\hline
0.5 & 1mins, 19sec & 6mins, 36sec \\
\hline
1 & 1mins, 7sec & 6mins, 52sec \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}



\section*{Question 3.1}


We run 6 sort applications on different sizes (3*2GB, 2*4GB 1*10GB) under Fifo scheduler, Fair scheduler (preemption disabled), and Fair scheduler
(preemption enabled) (we used Fair scheduler within the pool).



Jobs are launched with a decreasing input size order and 10 second interval between two
jobs.
See the execution time, data locality and the waiting time of the applications. what can
you observe?
